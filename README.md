#Task_Manager_By_Yahel

Task Manager is a full-stack application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Built using FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend, it provides a simple interface for task management. The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, ensuring smooth integration between the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database.

#System Design Overview
This section provides an overview of the major components in the Task Manager system and their respective roles.
**Project Diagram**
â€¢	**Frontend (Streamlit):** Provides the user interface to interact with tasks and task details.
â€¢	**Backend (FastAPI):** Handles core logic such as CRUD operations for task management.
â€¢	**Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores task-related data persistently.
â€¢	**Docker Compose:** Orchestrates the services to ensure smooth communication between the frontend, backend, and database.

#Components
â€¢	**Frontend:** Simple and intuitive interface, built with Streamlit, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete tasks.
â€¢	**Backend API:** Exposed via FastAPI, it manages task operations (CRUD).
â€¢	**Database:** PostgreSQL is used to store task-related data.

#Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
.
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/                     # Contains FastAPI backend code for task management logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                  # API routes and logic for task management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models.py                # Database models and schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/                    # Contains the Streamlit frontend application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ streamlit_app.py         # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml           # Docker Compose configuration for orchestrating services
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt             # Dependencies for both frontend and backend
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                   # Files to be ignored by git

#How to Run the Project

**System Requirements**
Ensure the following dependencies are installed before setting up the project:
â€¢	**Docker:** Download Docker
â€¢	**Docker Compose:** Install Docker Compose
â€¢	**Python 3.8+:** Make sure you have Python version 3.8 or higher installed.

**Installation Steps:**
1.	Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
cd task-manager

2.	Build and Run the Project Using Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

This will:
â€¢	Build the backend and frontend services.
â€¢	Start the PostgreSQL database.
â€¢	Expose the necessary ports:
o	Frontend UI: http://localhost:8501
o	Backend API: http://localhost:8000

3.	Access the System
â€¢	Frontend (UI): Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser to interact with the UI.
â€¢	Backend (API): Access the backend API at http://localhost:8000.

4.	Stopping the System
To stop the system, run the following command:
docker-compose down
