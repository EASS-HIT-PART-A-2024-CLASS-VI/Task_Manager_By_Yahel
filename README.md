# Task_Manager_By_Yahel

**Task Manager** is a full-stack application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **Streamlit** for the frontend, it provides a simple interface for task management. The application is containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**, ensuring smooth integration between the frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database.
